## Intro
Welcome to the future of connected living with our Smart Home Automation System! In a world where technology seamlessly integrates into our daily lives, our IoT project aims to transform traditional homes into intelligent and responsive living spaces. The convergence of devices, data, and connectivity allows us to create an innovative ecosystem that enhances convenience, energy efficiency, and overall well-being.

## The Context
This project is our Portfolio Project, concluding our third sprint at ALX. We were able to choose who we wanted to work with and what we wanted to work on, as long as we present a working program at the end of the three weeks of development.

## The Team
* **Aymane El yamani** [aymaneelyamani3@gmail.com] - Software Engineer and indutrial automation engineer.
* **Hind Ouchani** [ouchani.hind@gmail.com] - Test engineer.

## Technologies
  * For the database:
            -  Either we will be working everything with embeded system so we will use light way database, so it will either MariaDb or LightSQL
            -  Or an normal one since our embeded system will only aquire the Data, then we will use an event driven technologie to sent it to our server to be logued
  * about the event driven Data aquisition, i think we will use RabbitMq with protocole MQTT to transfer the data aquired from our raspberry pi to the server.
  * for the server either be it in the raspberry pi or independent, we will use SQL alchemy to log the data to our database
  * For the Fron end we will do our first essaie to work with Angular.
## Challenge
  * Our bigest chalenge will be time, i hope that we will be able to finish it on time
